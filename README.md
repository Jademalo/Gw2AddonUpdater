# Gw2AddonUpdater
A simple, easy to use, and convenient updater for Guild Wars 2 addons.

Installation:
 - Drop the bat file of your choice into the root guild wars 2 folder - that is, the same folder your Gw2-64.exe is located in
 - Double click the bat file to run it
 - Follow the prompts
 - Success!

Todo:
 - Rewrite in powershell
 - Investigate creating an on-booy service that checks for updates
 - check for updates before updating, possibly by verifying md5 hashes (does d912pxy even have an md5 hash? Too many files)
 - optionally make a version that checks for updates, updates, then boots gw2
 - investigate adding more add-ons such as Taco
 - clean up any bugs
 - clean up bat script
 - probably more.
