# Gw2AddonUpdater
A simple, easy to use, and convenient updater for Guild Wars 2 addons.

Installation:
 - Drop the bat file of your choice into the root guild wars 2 folder - that is, the same folder your Gw2-64.exe is located in
 - Double click the bat file to run it
 - Follow the prompts
 - Success!

Todo:
 - Clean up the script
 - Iron out any possible bugs
 - Replace the powershell extraction with bash script extraction
 - optionally, entirely rewrite in Powershell, possibly as an optional file, or a replacement.
 - Maybe more.
